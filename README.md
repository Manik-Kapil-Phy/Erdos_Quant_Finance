# Github Repository for the Quantitative Finance course at Erdos Institute Course.
### Manik Kapil
In these Repository I have added four files which are four mini projects for my Quantitative Finance Course
The first one deal with portfolios and how you create a low risk and high risk one.
The second one deals with the normal distribution of the log returns.
The third visualized how call and put option prices and their time derivatives respond to changes in expiration and spot price under the Black-Scholes model.
The fourth simulated delta-hedged and unhedged call options in the Heston model to compare profit distributions.
